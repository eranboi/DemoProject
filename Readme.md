#This is a Hypercasual Game made in Unity.

## The game consist of two phrases. First one is race where you have to race till the finish line against AI controlled agents and the second one is to paint a wall.
## UI shows you how much of the wall you have painted in realtime. I used render texture and pixel counting for that to work.
